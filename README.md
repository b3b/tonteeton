# TonTeeTon

Empowering TON DeFi with a community-driven, trusted oracle solution.

## Description
The TonTeeTon project seeks to enhance the capabilities of TON DApps by enabling trusted off-chain computations using secure memory enclaves. 

By providing verifiable computation results and protecting sensitive data, TonTeeTon empowers developers to build sophisticated off-chain solutions while leveraging the benefits of the TON blockchain.

## TonTastic

During the ETH Belgrade hackathon, as part of our vision, we plan to develop a Telegram Mini-app demonstrating how to create a gamified quiz application utilizing TON and the TonTeeTon solution : https://github.com/tonteeton/tontastic .
